----------------------------------

This products provides a content type that represents a specific field in a
company, such as a department or area. It is mostly useful for intranets, especially when used in conjunction with the package s17.employee since together they allow you to represent a full organizational chart as full-featured content objects.

Don't Panic
-----------

Once the product is installed you can see that the content type is now
available for adding. This type is very simple, and only has three fields:

    - Title
    - Description
    - Area manager

It is designed to work with the Employee content type from s17.employee
product. In the field *Area Manager* we can write the name of the employee
that manages that area or browse through a list to select one or more of them.

This type is also a container so we are able to add employees and other
organizational units inside this one.


Mostly Harmless
