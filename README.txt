Once the product is installed you can see that the content type now is
available to add. This type is very simple because it only have three fields
wich are:

    - Title
    - Description
    - Area manager

It is designed to work with an employee from s17.employee product. In the
field *Area Manager* we can start writing the name of the employee that manage
that area and the widget will automatically give us the url pointing to that
employee.

Also this type is a container, so, we going to be able to add employees and
more organizational units to this one.
